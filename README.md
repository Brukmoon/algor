# algor
A collection of generic algorithms implemented in C, aiming to provide a well-maintained and commented foundation for other projects while helping new programmers learn from peer-reviewed code.

# tests
The code is tested by an extensible home-made unit test framework which is part of the solution. Data sets are small, but they can be easily expanded.
